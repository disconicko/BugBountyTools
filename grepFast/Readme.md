## Grep Fast
Grep Fast is a Jython Burpsuite extension that scans all responses from webpages and searches the content matching regular expressions. Whenever a match is found, the extension will create an issue in the dashboard for investigation. Custom regular expressions can be created, saved, and turned on/off depending on the content you are trying to discover. I take no credit for the Grep Fast idea or name, I just wanted to re-create an extension to do what Tomnomnom's GF tool does in Burpsuite.

For all ideas to uplift this tool please reach out or create a push request. This was my first extension and I am sure my code can be uplifted in many areas. 
I hope everyone finds this tool useful.
